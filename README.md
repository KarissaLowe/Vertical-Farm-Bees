#Investigating Osmia Lignaria as Strawberry Pollinators for Urban Vertical Farms

This is the project I did for my undergraduate thesis at Princeton University. I investigated the pollination ability of the solitary bee, Osmia lignaria, in a vertical farm growing strawberries. 

*By setting up three small vertical farms, I examined the differences in fruit amount, size, quality and overall plant health in the presence and absence of O. lignaria. 
*I further analyzed whether UV spectrum light and room temperature affected bee health and strawberry production.
