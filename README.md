## Investigating Osmia Lignaria as Strawberry Pollinators for Urban Vertical Farms

<p align="left">
This is the project I did for my undergraduate thesis at Princeton University in 2020. I investigated the pollination ability of the solitary bee, Osmia lignaria, in indoor vertical farms growing strawberries. You can read the abstract and complete paper by downloading the PDF file. Here is a summary of the project: 
</p>

* By setting up three small vertical farms, I examined the differences in fruit production, size, quality and overall plant health in the presence and absence of O. lignaria. 
* I further analyzed whether UV spectrum light and room temperature affected bee health and strawberry production.

Descriptions of R files:
</p>

* **Strawberry and Plant Analysis**
  * **Question 1** - Were the number of berries produced by plants different between bee/no bee treatments? This file contains R code for Figure 1 and the Zero-inflated regression (and additional T Tests) to compare number of berries.
  * **Question 2** - Did the size of strawberries differ between bee/no bee treatments? This File contains R code for Figure 2 and T Tests to compare volume of berries between treatments. 
  * **Question 3** - Did the sugar content of the strawberries differ between bee/no bee treatments? This File contains R code for Figure 3 and Tests to compare dry matter content of berries between treatments 
  * **Question 4** - Did plant health differ between UV treatments and Season Trials? This File contains R code for Figure 4 and Tests to compare the root:shoot ratio of the plants between both season trials and room treatments
    
* **Bee Health and Behavior Analysis**
  * **Question 5** - Does UV light and temperature conditions affect bee mortality? This File contains R code for bee death rate models testing UV grouping/season grouping. (Figure 5 and 6)
  * **Question 6** - We provided four alternative food choices to investigate the best food supplement for the bee species: O. lignaria. Which food suppliement had the most visits and was this affected by temperature conditions?
