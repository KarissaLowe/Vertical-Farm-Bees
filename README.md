## Investigating Osmia Lignaria as Strawberry Pollinators for Urban Vertical Farms

<p align="left">
This is the project I did for my undergraduate thesis at Princeton University. I investigated the pollination ability of the solitary bee, Osmia lignaria, in a vertical farm growing strawberries.

* By setting up three small vertical farms, I examined the differences in fruit amount, size, quality and overall plant health in the presence and absence of O. lignaria. 
* I further analyzed whether UV spectrum light and room temperature affected bee health and strawberry production.

* **Strawberry and Plant Analysis**
  * Question 1 - Were the number of berries produced by plants different between treatments and season trials? This file contains R code for Figure 1 and the Zero-inflated regression (and additional T Tests) to compare number of berries.
  * Question 2 - Does the volume of strawberries differ between different treatments? This File contains R code for Figure 2 and T Tests to compare volume of berries between treatments
