## Investigating Osmia Lignaria as Strawberry Pollinators for Urban Vertical Farms

<p align="left">
This is the project I did for my undergraduate thesis at Princeton University. I investigated the pollination ability of the solitary bee, Osmia lignaria, in a vertical farm growing strawberries. 
</p>

* By setting up three small vertical farms, I examined the differences in fruit amount, size, quality and overall plant health in the presence and absence of O. lignaria. 
* I further analyzed whether UV spectrum light and room temperature affected bee health and strawberry production.

Descriptions of R files:
</p>

* **Strawberry and Plant Analysis**
  * **Question 1** - Were the number of berries produced by plants different between treatments and season trials? This file contains R code for Figure 1 and the Zero-inflated regression (and additional T Tests) to compare number of berries.
  * **Question 2** - Does the volume of strawberries differ between different treatments? This File contains R code for Figure 2 and T Tests to compare volume of berries between treatments 
  * **Question 3** - Does the Dry Matter Content (DMC) of the strawberries differ between treatments? This File contains R code for Figure 3 and Tests to compare dry matter content of berries between treatments 
  * **Question 4** - Does the root:shoot ratio of the plants differ between UV treatments and Season Trials? This File contains R code for Figure 4 and Tests to compare the root:shoot ratio of the plants between both season trials and room treatments
* **Bee Health and Behavior Analysis**
  * **Question 5** - How is bee death rate affected by UV light treatment and Season conditions? This File contains R code for Figure 5 and 6 and comparisons of death rate models including UV grouping/season grouping and not.
  * **Question 6** - We provided four alternative food choices to investigate the best food supplement for O. lignaria. Which food suppliement had the most visits and was this affected by season condition?
